# Middleman-ricpic

A small project template for [Middleman], the fantastic static site building
tool. Without any front-facing extension, even the blog one. Use for starting
the new site. Add what's necessary later.

And yes it is blatantly ripped off fine [middleman-neato] template. Thanks @shkm!

The name is based on czech saying ricpic (read ritz-pitz) which means at once.


## Features

Ricpic sets you up with the following, straight out of the box:

- [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) templating
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) support with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) & [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io)
- [Coffee script](http://coffeescript.org) Coffee script instead of plain javascript
- A basic page layout & 404 page based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) (in Slim)
- Simple Google Analytics support
- [Livereload](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-livereload)
- CSS & Javascript minification and gzipping on build

Thanks to the brilliance of [Middleman], this should get you up and running on new projects pretty darn fast.


## Use

Install [Middleman]:

    gem install middleman


Clone Ricpic:

    git clone git@github.com:pepe/middleman-ricpic.git my-project

Install gems and get to work!

    cd my-project
    bundle install
    middleman


## Template Install

If you find yourself using ricpic often, you can install it as a middleman template:

    git clone git@github.com:shkm/middleman-ricpic.git ~/.middleman/ricpic

Now you can simply init new projects with the Ricpic template:

    middleman init -T=ricpic my-project

Just don't forget to update `~/.middleman/ricpic` every now and then.

Jamie Schembri @shkm for middleman-neato, which is probably much better for you than this.
